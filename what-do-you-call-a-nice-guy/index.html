<p>This means that he would likely smile when he sees you, show his palms when he is. Guys really like it when you call them handsome or sexy, especially since most men aren’t complimented on their looks that often, so telling a guy he’s sexy or handsome will really build up their confidence and push them to be the best men they can to live up to those nicknames.
