How I organize my bedroom My closet! Organizing Made Fun How I From organizingmadefun.blogspot.com
I am looking for suggestions for placement of my 6.5&#39;x3&#39; bed in my small bedroom. The ideal place to position a bed is usually considered to be right at the centre of the longest wall in the room. A full size bed for a small room isn’t exactly hard to find, but a full size bed in addition to two twin beds is not nearly as simple. Space under the bed, or a divan with built in drawers, can be utilized for items like shoes and bags, too.
