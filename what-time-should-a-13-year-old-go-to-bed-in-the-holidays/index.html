<p>What responsibilities should a 13 year old boy have? My 13 yr old is in bed for 9.30 during the week and at the weekend she is in bed at 10.30 at the latest. I just struggle to know what time bed time should be on a school night at the moment he goes at 9pm as he is a early riser say 530am/6am. Hi i live in the uk.

You will be given multiple results based on your age as well as your goal wake time or bedtime. Rua Amazonas, 1650, Bairro Garcia, Fones (47)34885445, (47)84295071.</p>

<p>My 13 yr old is in bed for 9.30 during the week and at the weekend she is in bed at 10.30 at the latest. Once your child is no longer napping, he will need an extra hour of sleep at night, so adjust bedtime accordingly. Take the time that they need to wake up and count backwards to help them get the sleep that they need. A load of people telling you what time their 12 year old goes to bed is utterly meaningless unless they also tell you what time their 12 year old gets up and whether they appear well rested.
