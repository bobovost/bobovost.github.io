Coolest Space Theme Birthday Party Coolest Kid Birthday Parties From coolest-kid-birthday-parties.com
A guide to planning your space birthday bash, if you will. To get it into the space theme, i put small milky way and mars bars (of course!) inside plastic easter eggs (because i always have random craft supplies, but they weren’t really necessary), and then covered them in scrunched up aluminium foil. The astronaut birthday theme is the time to conquer the moon or to create a great space mystery game that your future team of cosmonauts will. You can totally pull a stem party off, but it does require a little bit of advanced planning.
