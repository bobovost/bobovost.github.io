The church, the theatre and the courts of the royalty and aristocracy. Simply put, chamber music is “classical music” for a small ensemble. Written for performance in a chamber, or room, rather than in a church or theater. German (kammer), french (chambre), and english (chamber), the word means “small room” as distinct from a theatre or church, hall or auditorium, all of which are intended more for large public spectacle with perhaps a greater purpose, program or agenda.
