Creative Ways To Make Your Small Bedroom Look Bigger Hative From hative.com
To make your apartment smell better, you need the right arsenal of cleaning agents and scent diffusers. Add the three cups of water to the bottle. Replace sponges at least every one to two weeks, ensure clean towels are fully dry before folding and putting them away, and hang bath mats over the shower rod to help them dry. Ideally, your linens should be cleaned once a week, especially considering the number of bodily odors, oils, fluids, and skin cells that your sheets are subject to on a nightly basis.
