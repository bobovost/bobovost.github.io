Modern home office desk design From faburous.com
The best office table designs come in several shapes sizes and with a variety of wood such as walnut chestnut oak veneer etc. This simple office cabin design makes an interesting workspace with a wonderful view of greenery on one side. In this small office design, the desk is thin (which means it doesn&#39;t monopolize too much square footage) and runs the length of the room, allowing for plenty of space for two to work comfortably. They also usually come in different combinations of materials such as glass, wood (like walnut), and metal.
