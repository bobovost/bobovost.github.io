For example, a sleek sofa or chair will give you as much sitting room as its overstuffed cousin but will take up much less of your room. Having a living room which looks big and bright will definitely set your space for success because not only it will make your living room look better, but also empower you to play around with more bold decor choices without having to worry that they will darken or crowd your room.
